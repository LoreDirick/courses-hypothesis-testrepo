## CHAPTER 1: 

## Exercise 1: The `flight_delays.csv` dataset contains US flight information, such as departure location, arrival location, cancellations, and delays for US airline companies. Select one of the airline companies (eg. United Airlines), and using a significance level of 0.01, determine whether this airline company experiences significantly different delays compared to overall average delays.

# rename it back to .csv.gz
# unpack it using pandas
all_delays = df['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].dropna()

df_ua = df.loc[df['AIRLINE'] == 'UA']
ua_delays = df_ua['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].dropna()
