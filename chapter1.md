The `us_flight_delays.csv` dataset contains US flight information, such as departure location, arrival location, cancellations, and delays for US airline companies. Select one of the airline companies (eg. United Airlines), and using a significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.01, determine whether this airline company experiences significantly different delays compared to overall average delays.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import urllib.request

filename = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_6777/datasets/us_flight_delays.csv.gz.csv'
urllib.request.urlretrieve(filename, "us_flight_delays.csv.gz")

df_flights = pd.read_csv('us_flight_delays.csv.gz')
all_delays = df_flights['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].dropna()

df_ua = df_flights.loc[df_flights['AIRLINE'] == 'UA']
ua_delays = df_ua['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].dropna()
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
print(all_delays.mean())
print(ua_delays.mean())

# one sample t-test; compare population mean to one sample mean
popmean = all_delays.mean()
stats.ttest_1samp(ua_delays, popmean) 

```
