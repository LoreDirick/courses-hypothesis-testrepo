Analysis of variance has long been used in providing evidence of the effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs. Such evidence is required before the FDA will allow a drug to be marketed. In a recent test of the effectiveness of a new sleeping pill, three groups of 25 patients each were given the following treatments. One group was given the drug, the second group was given a placebo, and the third group was given no treatment at all. The results are as follows. Drug group: 12, 17, 34, 11, 5, 42, 18, 27, 2, 37, 50, 32, 12, 27, 21, 10, 4, 33, 63, 22, 41, 19, 28, 29, 8. Placebo group: 44, 32, 28, 30, 22, 12, 3, 12, 42, 13, 27, 54, 56, 32, 37, 28, 22, 22, 24, 9, 20, 4, 13, 42, 67. No-treatment group: 32, 33, 21, 12, 15, 14, 55, 67, 72, 1, 44, 60, 36, 38, 49, 66, 89, 63, 23, 6, 9, 56, 58, 39, 59. Determine whether or not the drug is effective. What about the placebo? Give differences in average effectiveness, if any exist.
